A fresh take on the **42 Piscine (Pool)** projects: re‑coded, re‑structured, and re‑imagined.  
This repository documents my journey of revisiting the 42 curriculum’s foundational exercises in **C programming, algorithms, and problem‑solving**, with a focus on:  

- ✨ Writing **cleaner, maintainable code**  
- 📚 Strengthening **fundamentals in algorithms & logic**  
- 🚀 Showcasing both **progress and growth** since the original Piscine  
- 🔄 Transforming practice projects into **long‑term references**

## 📖 About the 42 Piscine
The **Piscine** is an intensive 4‑week coding bootcamp at [School 42](https://42.fr) designed to test adaptability, persistence, and raw problem‑solving skills. Students dive into **C programming, shell scripting, and algorithms** while practicing rigorous peer‑to‑peer learning.  

By revisiting these projects, I’m not just completing exercises again I’m refining the way I think, code, and collaborate.

## 🧑‍💻 How to Use
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Sudo-ZED/42_Pool.git
2. Navigate into any module (e.g., C00) and explore exercises.
3. Compile using gcc (or your preferred C compiler):

./program

🚧 Status
This repo is actively updated as I:

Rebuild core exercises from scratch.
Refactor with clean code practices.
Log insights and lessons learned.
🦇 Final Note
Re‑implementing the Piscine is more than a redo. It’s a code workout routine: learn → review → refine → repeat.

If you’re a fellow 42 student, beginner in C, or coding enthusiast, I hope this repo helps with inspiration, study guidance, and persistent improvement.
